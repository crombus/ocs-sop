=== Notify Customer: Make changes to solve the alert

{resolution_description}

==== Delete Data
IMPORTANT: OCS CEPH CLUSTER IS NOT IN READONLY MODE. The following instructions only apply to OCS clusters that are near or full but NOT in readonly mode. Readonly mode would prevent any changes including deleting data (i.e. PVC/PV deletions)

The customer may delete data and the cluster will resolve the alert through self healing processes.

==== Current size < 1 TB, Expand to 4 TB

WIP: Assess ability to expand. Note, if OCS nodes are not dedicated (regular worker nodes) it is not possible to guarantee resources between the time SRE assesses and customer responds.

The customer may increase capacity via the addon and the cluster will resolve the alert through self healing processes.

==== Current size = 4TB
Please contact Dedicated Support.
