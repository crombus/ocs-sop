1. several alerts fire

2. check ceph status - OSDs are full
ceph osd df (over 80%)

3. OUTSIDE of Openshift: 
rules:
add volumes to your nodes with the osds. if necessary
create vols to be consumed by LSO, in different regions.
if you don't get all 3 availabiltiy zones (AWS)
if you use gp2

currently has to be in multiples of 3 and
have to be on unique nodes

4. add capacity with proper storage class (localvolume)
select the storage class for LOCAL storage - which was create when the storage cluster was created 

5. oc get pods | grep OSD
oc get pvc

6. ceph status
see new OSDs
watch recovery
watch USE%

this can take a while because recovery throttling 

ceph osd df (new OSD go up and old OSD go down)
7. watch for alerts to resolve

if there is a lot of backfill going on - you would see slight degradation during backfill.
