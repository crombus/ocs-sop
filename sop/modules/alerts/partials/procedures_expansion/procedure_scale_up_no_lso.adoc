=== Adding Storage Capacity when Local Storage Operator is NOT in USE

The procedure for scaling up capacity on AWS, Azure or VMWare is the same. Please follow the steps below.

.Check the current number of OSD pods and their status:
[source,shell]
----
oc get pod -o=custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,STATUS:.status.phase,NODE:.spec.nodeName -n openshift-storage | grep osd | grep -v prepare
----

.Example output
----
rook-ceph-osd-0-5686cb6949-q6t4r                                  Running     perf7-m4ngt-worker-vswpc
rook-ceph-osd-1-5ff8ffd585-w72vm                                  Running     perf7-m4ngt-worker-vwkqk
rook-ceph-osd-2-745d64bcff-s6kkn                                  Running     perf7-m4ngt-worker-7vq2w
----

.Increase the storagecluster spec:count by editing the storagecluster directly:
[source,shell]
----
oc edit storagecluster/ocs-storagecluster
----

Search for count: and increase by 1. Save and exit your editor. Watch for the new OSD pods to be in a running state.

.Example
----
[...]
spec:
  encryption: {}
  externalStorage: {}
  managedResources:
    cephBlockPools: {}
    cephFilesystems: {}
    cephObjectStoreUsers: {}
    cephObjectStores: {}
  storageDeviceSets:
  - config: {}
    count: 1     <<<<< increase by 1
[...]
----

Caution
It may take more than 5 minutes for new OSD pods to be in a Running state.
.Step 3: Check the current number of OSD pods and their status after increasing the storagecluster count:
[source,shell]
----
oc get pod -o=custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,STATUS:.status.phase,NODE:.spec.nodeName -n openshift-storage | grep osd | grep -v prepare
----

.Example output
----
rook-ceph-osd-0-5686cb6949-q6t4r                                  Running     perf7-m4ngt-worker-vswpc
rook-ceph-osd-1-5ff8ffd585-w72vm                                  Running     perf7-m4ngt-worker-vwkqk
rook-ceph-osd-2-745d64bcff-s6kkn                                  Running     perf7-m4ngt-worker-7vq2w
rook-ceph-osd-3-86dbcddc96-dmv9s                                  Pending     <none>
rook-ceph-osd-4-7d6f55bc6d-sctdc                                  Pending     <none>
rook-ceph-osd-5-67dc5d75f9-gthp2                                  Pending     <none>

.Step 4: Verify the added the capacity by checking the cluster status:
